The main objective of Proyecto Chaucha ([www.chaucha.cl](http://www.chaucha.cl)) is to educate chilean population about the use of cryptocurrencies by proposing a reliable, open, and decentralized monetary system, along with the necessary documentation to easily understand the functioning of the network and the used technology.

Official Wallet of [Proyecto Chaucha](http://chaucha.cl).
 
## What is this?
 
*Chauchera* is a modified client from the [Litecoin](https://litecoin.org/) (0.13.3) source code, that allows people to communicate with the network of **Proyecto Chaucha**.
 
With the *Chauchera* you will be able to send and receive *Chauchas* (`CHA`), which is the cryptocurrency used in this network.
 
## Why the name "Chauchera"?
 
In Chile is common calling "*chauchera*" to a little purse used to keep coins, and given that the cryptocurrency is called *Chaucha*, the normal thing was calling the wallet *Chauchera*.
 
## Information of the Chaucha network:
 
- Every minute *Chauchas* are generated as a reward of mining a block.
- With the first block **50.000 CHA** were generated for the financing of the project.
- Since block `#1` to `#2833` the reward was of **10 CHA** per block.
- From the `#2834` block to the `#50000` block the reward is variable.
- From the `#50000` block onwards, the reward is the **10 CHA** for block, divided in 2 every 2 years approximately.
- The difficulty of the mining of each block is dynamically recalculated from the 147000 block by using DGW.
- The maximum of *Chauchas* that will exist in the network is `10.800.000 CHA`.
- The PMC1 proposal defined the generation in 1.5 CHA and the Halving in 5 years from the `#220000` block
- The *Chaucha* network is based on [Litecoin](https://litecoin.org/).
